# PayFlow-Agile-Capstone 🚀
A Notion-based Agile workspace template for a hypothetical MVP project.

This project was a collaborative capstone initiative where our group functioned as a dedicated Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team members).
The initiative focused on applying Agile methodologies to a hypothetical case study: 'PayFlow,' a new mobile and web fintech application designed to help small businesses manage digital payments and track sales. Our primary objective was not to build the application itself, but to demonstrate proficiency in Agile documentation by designing and implementing a lightweight, auditable, and traceable documentation system within Notion, strictly adhering to Scrum principles and simulating the delivery timeline for an MVP. This Capstone project was initiated after I and my Team members Acquired the "Professional Scrum Master 1" Certificate.
